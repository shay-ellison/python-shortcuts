This is a collection Python Shortcuts that I find useful for either learning the language or for reference.

# Language

Python in this case refers to Python 3. The language was invented by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s as a successor to ABC.
Today, Python is commonly used for Web Programming, OS Scripting, and Machine Learning research. 
It is one of the top used languages in the world [according to GitHub](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2020/4).
